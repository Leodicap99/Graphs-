An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which, when removed along with associated edges,makes the graph 
disconnected (or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph). 

Time Complexity:- O(V+E)

1. Let's say we are in the DFS, looking through the edges starting from vertex vâ‰ root. If the current edge (v,to) is such that none of the vertices to or its descendants 
in the DFS traversal tree has a back-edge to any of ancestors of v, then v is an articulation point. Otherwise, v is not an articulation point.

2. Let's consider the remaining case of v=root. This vertex will be the point of articulation if and only if this vertex has more than one child in the DFS tree.

vector<vector<int>> graph;
vector<int> id,low;
vector<bool> vis;
int time=0;
void dfs(int v,int p=-1)
{
	vis[v]=true;
	id[v]=low[v]=time++;
	int children=0;
	for(auto &to:graph[v])
	{
		if(vis[to])
			low[v]=min(low[v],id[to]);
		else
		{
			vis[to]=true;
			low[v]=min(low[v],low[id]);
			if(low[to]>=id[v] && p!=-1)
				IS_CUTPOINT(v);
			children++;
		}
	}
	if(p==-1 && children>1)
		IS_CUTPOINT(v);
}
void cut_vertices()
{
	vis.assign(n,false);
	id.assign(n,0);
	low.assign(n,0);
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		dfs(i);
